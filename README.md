OVERVIEW:

This project is a simple Chrome Extension that helps track how much time you spend on different websites. It also shows if the time spent is productive or unproductive. I built this project as part of my CodTech internship, and it gave me hands-on experience with web development, Chrome extensions, and basic productivity analytics.

What This Extension Does:

Tracks time you spend on websites while using Google Chrome

Tells you which websites are productive (like coding websites) and which are unproductive (like social media)

Shows the data in a popup when you click the extension icon

Stores the time data locally in the browser using Chrome’s storage system

Why I Built This:

The main idea was to create a basic productivity tool that gives users a clear picture of where they spend their time online. Many of us spend time on both useful and distracting websites, and this extension helps to bring more awareness.

Since I’m a beginner, I kept the code simple and easy to understand. This helped me learn how Chrome extensions work and how JavaScript can be used to build real tools.

Technologies Used:

HTML: To design the popup window

CSS: To style the popup

JavaScript: For tracking the active tab and updating time

Chrome Extension APIs: Like chrome.tabs, chrome.storage, and chrome.runtime to interact with the browser

How It Works:

The extension runs in the background and checks which website (domain) you're visiting.

Every second, it adds time to that website in local storage.

When you click the extension icon, it shows you the list of websites and how much time you've spent on each.

Some websites are marked as productive (like github.com, stackoverflow.com) and others as unproductive (like facebook.com, instagram.com).

The colors show which websites are good (green) and which are distractions (red).

How to Use It:

Download or clone this repository.

Open Google Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/

Turn on Developer Mode (top right)

Click Load Unpacked and select the folder that has this extension’s files.

Pin the extension from the toolbar.

Open different websites and click the extension icon to see your time usage!

Conclusion:

This project helped me understand how browser extensions work and how to use JavaScript in a real-world application. It was a great learning experience and a good step toward becoming a full-stack developer.
